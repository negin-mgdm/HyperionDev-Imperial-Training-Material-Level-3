information provided in the task and discuss both good and bad elements
in the website’s UI.

Good elements:
From my perspective, the website's fast loading is its only good aspect. 
This refers to the site's ability to quickly display content without significant delays.

Bad elements:
Use of Colours, Textures, and Typography Without Purpose:
Colours, textures, and typography are used without a clear purpose which can result in a chaotic 
and confusing visual experience. 

Inconsistency:
Inconsistency in design, layout, and typography creates a disorienting user experience and 
confusion while using the website. 

Poor Readability:
Poor readability is a significant issue in the UI design of this website, due to small and unclear 
fonts and extreme colour contrast. This can frustrate users, as it makes it challenging to 
consume content or navigate the website. 

Outdated Design:
An outdated design of the website indicates that the website's appearance and functionality are not 
in line with current design trends. This can give the first impression that the site is not well-maintained 
or up-to-date, potentially destroying the user's trust in website's content.

Overall, this website's UI is not good and should be improved.
