Answer the following questions:
● In a document titled requirements.txt, consider the following statement
of requirements for part of a ticket-issuing system:
An automated ticket-issuing system sells rail tickets. Users select their
destination and input a credit card and a personal identification number.
The rail ticket is issued and their credit card account is charged. When the
user presses the start button, a menu display of potential destinations is
activated, along with a message to the user to select a destination. Once a
destination has been selected, users are requested to input their credit
card. Its validity is checked and the user is requested to input a personal
identifier. When the credit transaction has been validated, the ticket is
issued.
Based on this:

● Discuss any ambiguities or omissions in the statement of
requirements for this part of a ticket-issuing system.

The statement lacks clarity on how users input their credit card information 
(Is it through a physical card swipe, contactless method or some other method?), 
how the credit transaction is validated (What checks are performed to validate 
the credit card transaction, and what happens if the validation fails?), 
and the process for charging the credit card (How  the payment is processed and 
confirmed, what happens if the process failed?). Information about how users input 
their credit card, how transactions are checked, and how payments are processed 
and handled in case of errors is needed.
The statement mentions the requirement for a personal identification number (PIN), 
but it doesn't explain its purpose or how it's used. Is the PIN meant for extra security 
or authentication? We need more details to understand the role and importance of the PIN.
The statement also says that tickets are issued, but it doesn't mention whether they are 
physical or electronic. It also doesn't explain how the ticket issuance process works or 
what happens in case of errors. We need to know the format of the tickets and understand 
the steps involved in ticket issuance, including how errors are handled.

                              *****************************  

● Write a set of non-functional requirements for the ticket-issuing
system above. You are free to make assumptions regarding the
system based on ambiguities or omissions you identified previously.

Usability:
The system should be designed to be user-friendly, ensuring that individuals with different 
technical skills can easily navigate it. It should provide clear, simple instructions, 
and the interface should be intuitive. We want all users, regardless of their tech skills, 
to feel comfortable while interacting with the system.
Performance:
The system's performance is a critical aspect of providing users with a seamless experience 
without delay. It should respond quickly when users select their options, input their 
credit card information, and validate their transactions. Additionally, it should efficiently 
handle multiple transactions happening at the same time, making sure that users experience 
minimal waiting times, even during peak usage periods.
Reliability:
Users should be able to rely on the system for smooth and uninterrupted service. 
The system should operate without unexpected interruptions or errors. 
In an event that errors do occur, the system should handle them and communicate clearly with 
users through appropriate error messages. This ensures that users are kept informed, 
especially in situations like credit card validation issues.
Security:
Safeguarding user data, particularly sensitive information like credit card details and 
personal identifiers, is crucial. The system should adhere to established industry standards 
for data encryption and protection. Regular security assessments should be carried out to 
identify and address any vulnerabilities. This proactive security approach is important to 
maintaining user trust and protecting their information.
