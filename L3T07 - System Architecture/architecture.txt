● Do some research to find real-world examples of when each architecture
pattern would be most appropriate to use. Write down your examples, and
state your reasons why each pattern would be most appropriate for each
of the examples you found.

client-server architecture:
Client-server architecture is used in online games like League of Legends (LoL), Wild Rift, 
and web services such as Web of Science, Science Direct, and YouTube because it efficiently 
manages interactions, content distribution, and user data for a large user base.

layered architecture:
Layered architecture is suitable for cloud storage services such as OneDrive and Google Drive 
because it allows for a structured and organised approach to data storage and retrieval. 
Layered architecture is used to separate components, such as the user interface, business logic, 
and data storage. This separation allows for easier maintenance, scalability, and flexibility 
in handling large volumes of user data and interactions.

Repository architecture:
Repository architecture is well-suited for systems like MySQL, Oracle Database, and GitHub 
because it provides a structured approach for organising and managing data and resources. 
In the case of databases like MySQL and Oracle, it's essential to have a systematic way to 
store and retrieve data, and repository architecture serves this purpose effectively. 
GitHub, as a version control system, relies on repository architecture to keep code and 
collaboration well-organised, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.

Pipe and filter architecture:
Applications like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP use Pipe and Filter Architecture for image editing. 
Pipe and Filter Architecture enables a step-by-step, flexible approach to applying various filters 
and transformations to images. This modular setup simplifies the software's development and provides 
users with a versatile way to enhance and edit images.

● Give two examples of systems combining two or more patterns, and explain how these patterns 
complement each other.

1. TV: The system architecture of television and broadcast typically follows a combination of architectural 
patterns, including Layered Architecture, Client-Server Architecture and Pipe and Filter Architecture. 
Television and broadcast systems use layered architecture to organize components. 
They rely on client-server architecture to deliver content to viewers. 
Data processing involves a pipe and filter architecture. Repository architecture plays a smaller role 
as these systems focus on real-time content delivery.

2. Moodle: 
Moodle primarily follows a Layered Architecture, which is a characteristic feature of most 
Learning Management Systems (LMS). It separates functions into layers, including presentation, 
application, and data. Moodle also incorporates elements of repository architecture for 
content storage, follows a client-server model, and may involve data processing.  However, 
it doesn't rely on pipe and filter architecture for its core design pattern.
