● How does the waterfall methodology differ from agile?

Waterfall is typically used for projects with well-defined and stable requirements. 
Waterfall follows a sequential and linear approach and its projects tend to take longer to deliver a final product.
Additionally, in terms of customer feedback and involvement, it has a Minimal Customer Involvement 
which is typically occur only at the beginning and end of the project.
Agile is suited for projects where requirements may evolve and customer collaboration is essential. 
Agile follows an iterative and incremental approach and gets things done faster. 
Agile delivers small, useful parts quickly so you can see results sooner. 
Moreover, Agile encourages regular customer collaboration and feedback throughout the project.
As a result, the Waterfall methodology is a more strict, and plan-driven approach and is used when 
requirements are well-defined and stable, whereas Agile is a flexible, customer-centric, and adaptive approach 
and is used for projects with evolving requirements, focusing on flexibility, customer collaboration, 
and quicker delivery.

● Reread “Agile Manifesto”. Can you think of a situation in which one or
more of the four “values” could get a software team into trouble?

Value: "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools":
When a team relies on the skills of individual team members and doesn't use proper tools, 
it can lead to problems in large software projects. These issues include inconsistent work 
and difficulties when trying to make the project bigger. It's like building a complex structure 
with only hand tools – it might work for a small project, but for a large one it doesn’t work. 

Value: "Customer collaboration over contract negotiation":
In projects where specific details such as what needs to be done, when it should be done, 
and how much it will cost are essential, excessive customer involvement without clear agreements 
can create problems. This can result in unexpected changes and additional work that wasn't 
originally planned, making the project larger, causing delays, and increasing the overall cost.

● Describe the agile method in your own words.

Agile is a software development approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and 
delivering value quickly. Instead of planning everything at the start, Agile breaks the work into 
small steps. In each step, a little part of the software is made, and users give feedback. 
This allows for constant adjustments and improvements based on real user needs. Agile promotes teamwork and 
customer involvement which making it well-suited for projects where requirements are expected to change or evolve.

                            ***************************************************************

● Why do you think requirements change so much?

Requirements often change in software development because the world around the project is always changing. 
Businesses grow and adapt, customers provide feedback, and new technologies come up. 
Laws and competition can also impact requirements. Sometimes, mistakes or issues are found, 
or new people get involved and have different ideas. All of these things can lead to changes in what 
the software needs to do.

● Explain why first testing project features helps the programmer to develop
a better understanding of the system requirements.

Testing project features early in development helps programmers understand system requirements 
better because it provides a real-world perspective. It clarifies what the software should do, 
validates assumptions, and gathers feedback. Early testing also identifies missing requirements, 
improves quality, and reduces confusion in requirements. It's like road-testing a car to ensure 
it meets your expectations and makes any necessary adjustments for a smoother ride.
